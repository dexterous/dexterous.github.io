title: ! '... beyond Programming (and Development)'

---

Quite some time ago, I'd written about the <a href="http://thinkaround.blogspot.com/2006/01/coding-vs-programming.html">difference between Coding and Programming</a>. That idea has been long over due for update, so here goes.<br /><blockquote>Coding is about how you should write,<br />Programming is about how you shouldn't;<br />Development is about bringing it all together,<br />Solving is about putting it out there!</blockquote><blockquote>Coding as about the Language and Syntax,<br />Programming is about the Paradigm, the Thought Process;<br />Development is about Dependencies and Integration,<br />Solving is about Understanding and Reacting.<br /></blockquote><blockquote>Coding is represented by the 'Writing' metaphor,<br />Programming is epitomized by the 'Construction' metaphor;<br />Development is idealized by the 'Evolution' metaphor,<br />Solving aims to bring 'Satisfaction' all over!<br /></blockquote><blockquote>Coding defines the Solution,<br />Programming defines the Problem too;<br />Development defines who will solve it,<br />Solving <span style="font-style: italic;">actually</span> does it!</blockquote><blockquote>Coding creates the Implementation,<br />Programming creates the Interface;<br />Development creates the Framework,<br />Solving creates the Application.<br /></blockquote><blockquote>Coding is about "Getting it in place",<br />Programming is about "Getting to know it!";<br />Developing is about "Getting it across",<br />Solving is about "Getting it done!"<br /></blockquote><blockquote>Coding gets you Paid,<br />Programming makes you Employed;<br />Development makes you Engaged,<br />Solving makes you Satisfied.</blockquote><blockquote>Coding is what we HAVE to do,<br />Programming is what we SHOULD be doing;<br />Development is what we LIKE to do,<br />Solving is what we MUST do!</blockquote>
