title: Fragments of a wanderer

---

It's been too long since my last post. In my meanderings through the lonely forest, I stumbled upon a familiar voice, <a href="http://petrichor.rediffiland.com//scripts/xanadu_diary_view.php?postId=1180698490">words from an old friend</a>.<br /><br />My mind wanders past the signs in my subconsciousâ€“<br /><br /><blockquote>The world is an alien place; ideas I don't need, much less want, are forced onto me; my dreams come not to me anymore; tranquil sleep is but a distant memory.</blockquote><br />Everytime I think about that, I wonder if this is the world we leave for the generations to come; will this be our legacy? Have we failed our unborn children, just as we accuse those before us?<br /><br /><blockquote>Or... could <em>I</em> just be looking at it all wrong?</blockquote><br />I think it's going to be a while before I can write straight again.
