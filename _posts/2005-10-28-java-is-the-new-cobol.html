title: Java is the new COBOL
---

Alright, now I know for <em>sure</em> that Java is seriously misunderstood! Don't get me wrong, I agree with the title, it's just the freaking reasons people give you for this!! Here's what I think.<br /><br />Java is the new COBOL beacuse both are...<br /><ul><li>Standardized through a detailed, documented Specification -> <a href="http://java.sun.com/docs/books/jls/second_edition/html/j.title.doc.html">Java Language Specification</a></li><li>Platform independent; as a direct consequence of the above</li><li>Significantly readable. Infact, both were designed with readability in mind (COBOL was kinda <strong>Programming for Managers</strong>!)</li><li>Built with the intent of seperating concerns. Used effectively, they let you manage the business and not the systems.</li><li>Expansive in their enterprise penetration. Ubiquitous.</li><li>Always in the backgoround, the unsung heros!</li></ul><p>... not because...</p><ul><li>Java has turned legacy. What idioit came up with that one?</li><li>Java is too verbose. OK, Java is verbose; but not TOO, THREE, FOUR...</li><li>Java makes programming simple. Programming <strong><em>IS</em></strong> hard. Java doesn't make it simple, it just makes it easier to write and read code!</li></ul><p>... and Java also has to it's avantage that it is...</p><ul><li>General purpose; Desktop, Enterprise, Mobile, Embedded, Realtime, ... did we miss anything??!</li><li>Deployable in a variety of ways; Application, Applets, Java WebStart, J2EE</li><li>Easily interfaced to most other systems</li><li>Correctly Open source; have you seen the number of Java projects running on the Internet!!!!</li></ul>
