title: Defining Leadership
---

From the Oxford English Dictionary–<br /><br /><blockquote>[to] lead (v): conduct, guide, esp by going in front; direct movements, actions or opinions of</blockquote><blockquote>leader (n): person followed by others</blockquote><p></p><p>So, let's go over that one more time. </p><blockquote>person followed by others... directing their movements, actions or opinions</blockquote><br />The whole thing instantly conjures up images of a Seargent carrying his platoon through the tall grass or a Captain marching his company into battle. Respect, Trust,... <strong><em>Glory</em>!!!</strong><br />So what's wrong with that? Nothing, except that contemporary corporate culture seems to be the only place where the word <strong>Leader</strong> immediately follows the word <strong>Team</strong>. "So,” you ask, "what's wrong with a team having a leader? Most normal thing in the world!" Or so you think...<strong><em>!</em></strong><br />If you look at the above analogies colsely, you will notice that <em>neither</em> a platoon, <em>nor</em> a company is a team. They are hierarchical structures built into the military chain of command!<br />A Team is...<br /><blockquote><p>... made up of peers, equals that function as equals.</p><p align="right"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Peopleware-Productive-Projects-Teams-2nd/dp/0932633439/sr=1-1/qid=1158291384/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-6860072-8486329?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books">Peopleware</a><br />By Tom DeMarco &amp; Timothy Lister</p></blockquote><br />Even the military accepted this when they came up with the idea of special-purpose (ops) teams. Such teams comprise specialists who set aside their ranks to funnel their respective skills into attaining a single, common goal. Teams in our industry have no reason to be an exception.<br /><blockquote><p>For all the deference paid to the concept of leadership (a cult word in our [software] industry), it just doesn't have much place here. </p><p align="right"><a href="http://www.amazon.com/Peopleware-Productive-Projects-Teams-2nd/dp/0932633439/sr=1-1/qid=1158291384/ref=pd_bbs_1/104-6860072-8486329?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books">Peopleware</a><br />By Tom DeMarco &amp; Timothy Lister</p></blockquote><br />Managers/Leaders are never part of the team for the simple reason that they can never be peers; another point sufficiently emphasized by TDM &amp; TRL.<br />Besides, we're talking creative people here. Creative people are inherently <em>Intelligent</em>! They don't need to be led around like some pack, and they sure as hell don't <em>want</em> to be!<br />What's even more amazing is the kind of stuff that gets passed off as Leadership qualities, things like:<br /><ul><li>Charm (:P)</li><li>Persuasiveness (:S)</li><li>Getting things done (!)</li><li>Maintaining the status quo (:o)</li><li>Assuming authority (out of the blue!)</li></ul><strong>Parting thought:</strong> With all the talk of <strong>situational leadership</strong>, we seem to want the same people to pick up the flag in all the <em>situations</em>!
