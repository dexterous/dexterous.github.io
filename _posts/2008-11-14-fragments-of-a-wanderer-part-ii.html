title: Fragments of a wanderer- Part II
---

Ever so tired you couldn't stay awake, but then go to bed only to end up staring at the ceiling all night long? Have I just screwed up my biological clock... or am I really losing it?!?<br /><br />Ever wonder why we hear birds chirping at 2:30 n the morning? Have we messed up their biological clocks with all the artificial lighting?!?
