title: Benchmarking Expertise
---

<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/">Wikipedia</a> defines as Expert as...<br /><blockquote><p align="justify">An <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expert">expert</a> is someone widely recognized as a reliable source of knowledge, technique, or skill whose judgment is accorded authority and status by the public or their peers.</p></blockquote>Some pretty big phrases there! Let's just list them down for now.<br /><ul><li>widely recognized</li><li>reliable source</li><li>judgement is accorded authority</li><li>peers</li></ul>Alright, on to the issue. I guess the debate of whether an expert is deemed an EXPERT by Qualification or Acceptance has been sufficiently settled. Refer the following for details:<br /><ul><li><a href="http://www.catb.org/%7Eesr/faqs/hacker-howto.html">How To Become A Hacker- Eric Steven Raymond</a></li><li><a href="http://blogs.sun.com/roller/page/oldmanmanager?entry=what_makes_good_engineer">What makes good engineer?</a></li></ul>What really remains to be settled is how we can benchmark a person's 'expertness'. I figure the four traits listed above could be a start, but most of them tend to raise questions. How 'widely' is enough 'widely recognized'? Just who are your 'peers'; people you work with, people of like mind?<br />I guess this is more of a controversy than a debate, but what the heck! :)
