_aka **I finally migrated my blog to GitHub Pages**_

I finally decided to move my blog over to [GitHub Pages](http://pages.github.com) (actually I moved over quite some time ago, just didn't get around to cleaning it up and announcing the shift) for a number of reasons; the most
important being:

* I wanted to [blog like a hacker](http://tom.preston-werner.com/2008/11/17/blogging-like-a-hacker.html);
* [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com) seemed like a fun project for my _Procrastination ToDo_ list;
* [GitHub](http://github.com)'s support for Jekyll made hosting a noop;
* And finally, [Blogger](http://blogger.com)'s rich text editor was beginning to *really* get on my nerves!

So, here we are... the new home for my ramblings.

BTW, I apologize profusely if your RSS reader belched out all 28 of my previous posts as a result of the ids changing
in the Atom feed.
